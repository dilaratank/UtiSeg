MSc Thesis project: Uterus Segmentation on TVUS Dataset

## Introduction
Transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) is pivotal for diagnosing pathologies related to the reproductive system in individuals assigned female at birth, often serving as the primary imaging modality for gynecologic symptoms evaluation. Despite recent advancements in AI-driven segmentation, such as nnU-Net for MRI scans, its application to gynaecological ultrasound images remains unexplored, highlighting a research gap in this domain. Our feasibility study aims to bridge this research gap by (1) creating a small-scale TVUS dataset of at least 100 patients for the purpose of automated uterus segmentation *, and (2) training and evaluating the performance of two state-of-the-art deep-learning segmentation models for the purpose of analyzing the feasibility of deep-learning-based segmentation on TVUS.

\* The dataset created for this study has not been made public, but consits of Â±1000 TVUS images where the uterus of the patient is visible
